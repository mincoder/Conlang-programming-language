# conlang
Conlang is a small programming language written in java on my spare time. It is meant to be the easiest written progrmmming lanuage. It is made in java and is not so much a programming language as a translator that translates to java. I need help with implemeting new features so dont be afraid to ask to be on the team or make a fork of the language. Version: Not even alpha
